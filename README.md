## Description

The initial goal of these surveys were to collect information about
Mangrove Kingfisher (*Halcyon senegaloides*) location for [a study with
geolocator](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Intra-african-Bird-Migration).
However, as surveys provided richer information, it was decided to
publish it on its own.

This dataset contains full/complete presence-only species list surveys
(=events) recorded over a transects of \~1km and during \~1hr. Each of
these transects is repeated once a month (= session) from May 2020 to
May 2021. The study area cover the habitat between the forest of Araboko
Sokoke Forest and Mida creek. Surveys were collected by bird guides from
the area (Daniel Kazungu, Juma Badi, Kibwana Ali, Saddam Kailo and
Mohammed Ali) and organized by Kirao Lennox, Raphaël Nussbaumer and
Colin Jackson from [A Rocha Kenya](https://www.arocha.or.ke/).

**Summary of count statistics.**

-   Number of session: 11
-   Number of events (surveys): 899
-   Number of occurrences (sightings): 29195
-   Number of species: 217

**Purposes:**

-   Collect standardized data on common specie between the forest
    habitat and the creek/coast habitat.
-   Reproducable survey to assess evolution in the futur.
-   Assess impact of deforestation on the ‘shamba’ (fields/farms).

**Type of data**

This dataset is published as a [Darwin Core
Archive](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) using a [sampling event
dataset](https://www.gbif.org/sampling-event-data) type.

**Data structure** The raw data collected on the field with the
birdlasser app are stored in
[`data/birdlasser_files`](data/birdlasser_files).
[`data/metadata.xlsx`](data/metadata.xlsx) contains the basic survey
informations. The metadata and raw data are combined in
[`CompileSessions`](scripts/CompileSessions.html) which also produces
the GBIF formatted output files [`events.csv`](data/events.csv) records
information related to the surveys and
[`occurrences.csv`](data/occurrences.csv) which contains information
about the individual sightings.

### Bounding box

The bounding box is **-3.418071° to -3.271515°** latitude and
**39.891823° to 40.04485°** longitude.

## Taxonomic coverage

We record all birds seen (*Aves sp.*) at the species level (with the
exeption of one hybrid Hybrid Lovebird *Agapornis fischeri x
personatus*). We use the taxonomy from the [Checklist of the Birds of
Kenya (5th Edition)](https://github.com/A-Rocha-Kenya/Birds-of-Kenya)
([ISBN:
9966-761-37-3](http://naturekenya.org/shop/checklist-of-the-birds-of-kenya-5th-edition/))
for the `scientificName` and `vernacularName`. The `taxonID` and
`taxonRank` are determined from the [eBird/Clements Checklist of Birds
of the World:
v2019](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/). See
[\#](section%20correction) for explanation on how the taxons were
intially recorded in the field and then filtered and matched to these
taxonomy list.

Our dataset contains **217** unique species belonging to **64**
families.

### Taxonomic ranks

**Kingdom**: *Animalia* (animals)

**Phylum**: *Chordata*

**Class**: *Aves* (birds)

## Temporal coverage

The temporal coverage is from **2020-05-19 to 2021-05-25**.

### Content providers

The surveys were designed by Raphaël Nussbaumer, Kirao Lennox and Colin
Jackson, organized by Kirao Lennox, performed by Daniel Kazungu, Juma
Badi, Kibwana Ali, Saddam Kailo and Mohammed Ali.

## Sampling Methods

### Study extent

The kenyan coast was once a large continuous forest called [Northern
Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest
mosaic](https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0125), of which
Arabuko Sokoke Forest is the largest reminder of today. Extensively
study, this forest have benefit from a hard protect from deforestation
and human influence. However, the surrounding habitat have been much
hammered by human extension and agricultural extension on what used to
be a forest. On the other side of our study area, Mida Creek is \[…\].

This is the habitat that we’ve targeted for our surveys. In order to
study the the distribution and abundance of common specie not neceserely
restricted to a specieific habitat (forest or mangrove). as well as
their association with habitat.

The transects were defined to cover the general habitat between Arabuko
Sokoke Forest, Mida Creek and the coast.They were design such that the
habitat is rather homogeneous during each 1hr survey (i.e. along the
forest edge or mangrove edge). In addition, the survey start and finish
near main road to facilitate access and early start (6am). See []() for
a map of the transects.

### Sampling Description

-   2 persons
-   records all birds seen and/or heard at the first time of the
    encounter (no count data, just presence/absence)
-   record the GPS location of the observer at the moment of the
    observation (not the bird)
-   Survey could be paused in case of heavy rain or if the land owner
    was asking questions. These information are recorded in the
    `dynamicProperties` and `eventRemarks` columns in `events`.
-   Survey of exactly 1 hours, ideally starting at 6am up to 10am. Some
    remote transects required to performed surveys up to 12am.
-   use the birdlasser app to record the bird species, location and
    additional comments

### Quality control

**Spatial error** phone GPS error or sightings entered later at wrong
locations were manually identified by plotting all sightings on a maps.
These locations were interpolated linearly between the surrounding
sithgitngs of the same survey.  
The column `georeferenceVerificationStatus` indicates if such
interpolation was performed and `georeferenceRemarks` provides the
original coordinate.

**Species list**

All species with up to 5 records were mannual verified by Raphaël
Nussbaumer, … A spreasheet was used to … []()… with the following code
use

The column `identificationVerificationStatus` and
`identificationRemarks` are used.

| Error–typo      | Typing error on the phone. Correct when possible with Equivalent specieID.                                                         |
| Error–taxonomy  | Issues with taxonomy (old/new names, split/merge, duplicate specieID etc…). ALWAYS enter Equivalent specieID.                      |
| Error–probable  | Possible species in the area but not sufficiently confident in the identification. Entries will be remove. See individual comments |
| Valid–known     | Species known to occur here.                                                                                                       |

| Valid–likely    | Uncommon species but probable enough to keep the data.                                                                             |

### Step Description

All processing steps from the original birdlasser datafile to the GBIF
formated file is performed with the [a Rmarkdown script
`CompileSessions.rmd`]().
